class_name Mission01Validator
extends RefCounted

## "ตรวจสอบแบบ" — checks all three points at once and applies the scoring rules:
##   * every point must have a device (with its reason) first, otherwise nothing is checked
##   * a point is right only when the chosen device AND its reason are right;
##     a wrong point is marked "wrong" (device) or "wrong_reason" (right device)
##   * each wrong point loses `penalty_per_wrong` (5) on every check while it stays wrong
##   * point scores and the total never go below 0
##   * all correct = design passed, the correctness score is final
## The whole mission score (30/50/20) is built by Mission01Validator.mission_score().
